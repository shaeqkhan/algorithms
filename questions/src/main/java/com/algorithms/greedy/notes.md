Greedy Algorithms
-----------------

An optimization problem can be solved using greedy algorithms if the problem has the following property -

At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
If a greedy algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem.
Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques.


Standard Greedy Algorithms
--------------------------

1. Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
	
	We create a MST by picking edges one by one. The greedy choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn't cause 
	a cycle in the MST constructed so far.
	
2. Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

	We create a MST by picking edges on by one. We maintain two sets, a set of vertices already included in MST and the set
	of vertices not yet included. The greedy choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.
	
3. Djiksta's Shortest Path
	
	Similar to Prim's. The greedy choice is to pick the edge that connects the two sets and is on the smallest weight path 
	from source to the set that contains vertices that are not yet included.
	
4. Huffman Coding

	It is a loss-less compression technique. It assign variable length bit codes to different characters. The Greedy Choice
	is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.
